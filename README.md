Poll
===========

Allows your site to capture votes on different topics in the form of multiple
choice questions.


USAGE
-----

The Poll module lets you create simple polls. You ask a question, provide
possible answers, and let your users vote. Poll then keeps a running tally of
the results.

When you create a poll at Content >> Add content >> Poll, you can also specify
the "base" vote counts (how many votes an item has at the start) and decide how
long the voting will run.

The poll items at path `/poll` allows you to see all of the current polls, vote
on them (if they haven't already) and view the results.

On the access control page Configuration >> User accounts >> Permissions, you
can decide which users have permission to vote, to see the voting results, and
to create polls of their own.

The `Most recent poll` block can be placed in layouts.

To change the settings for creating polls go to:
Structure >> Content types >> Poll >> Edit.
